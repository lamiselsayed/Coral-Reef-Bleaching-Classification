# Coral Reef Bleaching Classification -- README File

<em>This is a team project addressing the challenge of coral reef bleaching by analyzing its causes, including sea temperature, coral exposure, and location using four machine learning classification algorithms</em>

- Machine Learning Methods Used to Predict the Extent of Bleaching: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Na√Øve-Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model Selection Method: 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Evaluation Metrics Used: Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-Score, AUC

Project Breakdown:

- Data Preprocessing, Decision Tree Model, & SVM Model (Linear & Non-Linear SVM)
- Naive Bayes Model
- KNN Model


Model Performance Summary (F1-Score):

- Decision Tree: 86%
- Linear SVM: 84%
- Non-Linear SVM (Polynomial Kernel): 65%
- <b>Non-Linear SVM (RBF Kernel): 90%</b>
- Naive-Bayes: 73%
- KNN: 88%
